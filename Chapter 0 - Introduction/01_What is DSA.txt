## Data Structures and Algorithms are two different things:

Data Structures –  These are like the ingredients you need to build efficient algorithms. These are the ways to arrange data so that they (data items) can be used efficiently in the main memory. Examples: Array, Stack, Linked List, and many more. You don't need to worry about these names. These topics will be covered in detail in the upcoming tutorials.

Algorithms – Sequence of steps performed on the data using efficient data structures to solve a given problem, be it a basic or real-life-based one.  Examples include: sorting an array.

## Other Terminologies:

1.Database: Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updation.

2. Data Warehousing: Management of huge amount of legacy data for better analysis.

3. Big Data: Analysis of too large or complex data that cannot be handled by traditional data processing application and requires an specialized set of tools.
