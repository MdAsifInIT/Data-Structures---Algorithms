## Approximate Importance Ratings (Out of 100)

| **Topic**                                    | **Importance Rating** | **Rationale**                                                                                                 |

| **Data Types, Operators & Expressions**      | 85                    | Fundamental for understanding how C works at a low level; used in nearly every program.                       |
| **Control Structures & Loops**               | 80                    | Essential for controlling program flow and algorithm development.                                             |
| **Arrays & Number Manipulation**             | 75                    | Core for data handling and common in algorithmic problems.                                                    |
| **Functions, Recursion & Program Structure** | 80                    | Critical for modular programming and problem decomposition; recursion is a key conceptual tool.               |
| **Structures, Unions & Memory Layout**       | 70                    | Important for managing complex data but used less frequently compared to basic constructs.                    |
| **File Handling**                            | 65                    | Very practical for real-world applications, though typically more straightforward once basic I/O is mastered. |
| **Linked Lists**                             | 70                    | Fundamental for understanding dynamic data structures and pointer manipulation.                               |
| **Additional Topics**                        | —                     | (Embedded within other topics; e.g., command-line arguments and overall program design principles.)           |

## Notes

- **Multiple-Paper Consolidation:** Although one file is labeled as an End Semester CP paper and the other as a Mid-Semester Test, both have been analyzed to cover the full range of topics provided.
- **Overlap of Concepts:** Many questions address more than one topic. The grouping above is approximate and meant to help in organizing study efforts.
- **Flexibility in Interpretation:** Use this breakdown as a guide rather than an absolute rule—the importance ratings and percentage distributions are estimates based on the provided exam papers.
