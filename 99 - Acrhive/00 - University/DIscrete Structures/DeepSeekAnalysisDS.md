## Key Differences Between the Two Analyses

1. **Logic**: Importance drops slightly (**85 → 80**) when excluding MID SEM DS due to fewer predicate logic questions.
2. **Graph Theory**: Dominates more (**25.5% → 31.6%**) when excluding MID SEM DS, as End-Sem papers focus heavily on graphs.
3. **Relations**: Gains importance (**18.2% → 21.1%**) due to repeated questions on Warshall’s algorithm and Hasse diagrams.
4. **Combinatorics**: Reduced weightage (**7.3% → 5.3%**) as MID SEM DS includes more Inclusion-Exclusion problems.
5. **Functions**: Only covered in MID SEM DS (excluded in the second analysis).

## Critical Observations

- **High-Weightage Topics**:
  - **Graph Theory** (spanning trees, isomorphism, shortest path) and **Relations** (transitive closure, Hasse diagrams) are critical for End-Sem.
  - **Logic** (proofs, validity) and **Recurrence Relations** are foundational across all exams.
- **RSA Cryptography**: Consistently appears in all papers (~10% weightage).
- **Combinatorics**: Focused on Inclusion-Exclusion Principle; practice Venn diagram-based problems.
